# Backend Optimization & Refactoring Implementation Plan

## 1. Objective

To transform the VisAPI backend into a world-class, enterprise-grade system by:
- Breaking down large monolithic files (500-600+ lines) into smaller, focused modules
- Implementing modern 2025 best practices and design patterns
- Optimizing performance and reducing code complexity
- Improving test coverage and maintainability
- Upgrading to latest stable dependencies where beneficial

## 2. Exploration Summary

### Current State Analysis
- **71 NestJS files** with varying complexity levels
- **6 files exceeding 500 lines** requiring immediate refactoring
- **Test coverage**: Only 13 test files for 73 implementation files (~18% coverage)
- **Module count**: 15 modules with mixed responsibilities
- **Dependency state**: Modern stack (NestJS 11.1, Node 22, TypeScript 5.9)
- **Architecture**: Monolithic services with some shared libraries

### Key Problem Areas Identified

1. **Large Monolithic Services (500+ lines)**:
   - `orders.service.ts` (566 lines) - Mixed responsibilities
   - `whatsapp-message.processor.ts` (551 lines) - Hardcoded translations
   - `cbb-sync.processor.ts` (478 lines) - Complex business logic
   - `workflow-validation.service.ts` (472 lines) - Inline schema definitions
   - `auth.service.ts` (451 lines) - Multiple auth concerns

2. **Code Duplication**:
   - Similar error handling patterns across services
   - Repeated validation logic
   - Duplicate metric collection code
   - Common database query patterns

3. **Missing Modern Patterns**:
   - No CQRS implementation for complex domains
   - Limited use of decorators for cross-cutting concerns
   - No repository pattern for data access
   - Missing domain-driven design boundaries
   - No event sourcing for audit trails

4. **Performance Opportunities**:
   - No caching layer implementation
   - Missing database query optimization
   - No connection pooling configuration
   - Lack of batch processing optimizations
