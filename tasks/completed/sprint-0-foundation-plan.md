# Sprint 0: Foundation Implementation Plan

**Completed:** Mon Jul 14 22:45:49 IDT 2025

## Objective

Establish the core monorepo structure, Next.js frontend, NestJS backend, and development environment for the VisAPI workflow automation platform.

## Tasks

- [x] Set up NX monorepo structure with apps/packages directories ✓ Completed
- [x] Create Next.js 14 app with App Router in apps/frontend ✓ Completed
- [x] Create NestJS API gateway app in apps/backend ✓ Completed
- [x] Set up shared ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configs ✓ Completed
- [x] Create comprehensive .gitignore file ✓ Completed
- [x] Create Docker configuration for development ✓ Completed
- [ ] Set up basic CI/CD pipeline structure

## Technical Details

### Repository Structure
```

├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/          # Next.js 14 admin dashboard
│   └── backend/           # NestJS API gateway
├── packages/

├── docs/                  # Project documentation
└── infrastructure/        # Terraform and deployment configs
```

### Frontend (Next.js 14)
- App Router with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase client for authentication
- React Query for data fetching
- Shadcn/ui component library

### Backend (NestJS)
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Pino logger for structured logging
- Helmet for security headers
- Environment validation with @nestjs/config
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

### Development Environment
- Node.js 18+ with pnpm package manager
- Docker for local services (Redis, PostgreSQL)
- Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
- Shared ESLint/Prettier configuration

## Dependencies

### External Services Needed
- Supabase project (database + auth)
- Upstash Redis instance
- Vercel deployment target
- Render deployment target

### Package Dependencies
- NX for monorepo management
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- NestJS with core modules
- Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui
- Supabase client libraries
- Testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Monorepo structure is established with proper NX configuration
- ✅ Frontend app runs on localhost:3000 with basic routing
- ✅ Backend API responds on localhost:3001/api/v1/health
- ✅ Both apps can be started with single command (`pnpm dev`)
- ✅ ESLint and Prettier work across all packages
- ✅ Basic Docker setup for development environment
- ✅ Git repository is clean with proper .gitignore
- ✅ Documentation is in place for local development setup

## Next Steps for Sprint 1

After foundation is complete:
1. Implement Supabase authentication in frontend
2. Set up BullMQ task queue in backend
3. Create basic workflow trigger endpoints
4. Add monitoring and logging infrastructure
