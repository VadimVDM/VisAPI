# Markdown File Update Protocol

This document outlines the standard procedure for updating key markdown files in this project to reflect daily progress. Following these guidelines ensures consistency and clarity for both human developers and AI assistants.

## Part 1: Updating Task Progress Files

When a task is completed or at the end of a work session, update the relevant markdown file located in the `/tasks` directory. The update must be structured to cover the following points:

-   **Tasks Completed:** Provide a clear summary or list of all accomplished tasks.
-   **Challenges Encountered:** Detail any obstacles, errors, or issues that arose.
-   **Solutions Implemented:** Describe the specific fixes or workarounds used to resolve the challenges.
-   **Key Learnings:** Note any important insights, discoveries, or critical information that would be beneficial for future reference.
-   **Next Steps:** List all remaining tasks and outline the plan for subsequent work.

## Part 2: Updating `claude.md`

After updating the task-specific markdown file, update the main `claude.md` file. This file serves as a central knowledge base.

### `claude.md` Update Checklist:

1.  **Full Review:** Read through the entire `claude.md` file to understand its current state.
2.  **Refine Content:** Edit and polish the existing text for improved clarity, conciseness, and elegance.
3.  **Integrate Insights:** Seamlessly incorporate the most critical learnings and insights from the day's work.
4.  **Prune Outdated Information:** Remove any content that is redundant, irrelevant, or no longer accurate.
5.  **Final Polish:** Ensure the document is well-organized, readable, and optimized for both human developers and AI assistants.

## General Tone

Maintain a professional yet approachable tone throughout all updates. The style should be consistent with the existing documentation in this repository.
