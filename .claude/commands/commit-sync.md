# Git Commit and Sync Protocol

This document outlines the standard procedure for committing and synchronizing changes with the remote repository. Following these steps ensures a clean and understandable version history.

## Workflow

1.  **Commit Changes:**
    -   Commit all staged changes to our local repository.

2.  **Write a Descriptive Commit Message:**
    -   The commit message must be short and descriptive.
    -   Clearly highlight the key features, fixes, or modifications made in the commit.

3.  **Push to Remote:**
    -   After committing, push our changes to the remote repository to sync them with the main branch.
