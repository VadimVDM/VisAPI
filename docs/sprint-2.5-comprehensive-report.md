# Sprint 2.5: Comprehensive Architecture & Polish Report

**Completed:** July 15, 2025

## 1. Overview

Sprint 2.5 was a critical initiative to address technical debt, enhance security, and refactor the VisAPI monorepo architecture. This sprint strengthened the foundation for future development by implementing a proper shared library architecture, fixing critical security vulnerabilities, and establishing clean dependency boundaries.

The final polish phase of this sprint addressed the remaining code cleanup tasks and architectural refinements identified during code reviews. All recommended improvements have been successfully implemented, resulting in a cleaner, more secure, and professionally polished codebase, ready for Sprint 3.

## 2. Key Achievements & Tasks Completed

This sprint combined major architectural changes with detailed code polishing.

### 🏛️ A. Monorepo Architecture Overhaul

- **Shared Libraries Structure**: Implemented a comprehensive `/libs/` directory with 7 specialized libraries, establishing a clean, reusable codebase.
- **Zero App-to-App Imports**: Eliminated all direct imports between applications (e.g., `../../../apps/backend/src/`), enforcing strict separation of concerns.
- **NX Dependency Boundaries**: Configured project tags and module boundaries in `nx.json` to prevent architectural violations at the toolchain level.
- **Obsolete Modules Removed**: Deleted legacy `/apps/backend/src/config/` and `/apps/backend/src/supabase/` directories, removing duplicate code and standardizing on shared libraries.
- **Standardized Queue Names**: Updated `AdminService` and `AdminModule` to use the `QUEUE_NAMES` enum from `@visapi/shared-types`, ensuring type-safe queue management across the application.
- **Centralized Configuration**: Migrated backend and worker configuration to a shared `@visapi/core-config` library.

### 🔐 B. Security & Reliability Enhancements

- **Critical API Key Validation Fix**: Replaced a broken API key validation system with a secure prefix/secret pattern using `bcrypt.compare`, patching a major security vulnerability.
- **Distributed Idempotency Service**: Replaced an in-memory `Map` in `WebhooksController` with a robust, distributed `IdempotencyService` using Redis, ensuring webhook integrity across multiple server instances.
- **Hardcoded Credentials Removed**: Eliminated all hardcoded API keys and credentials from the frontend, implementing a secure JWT-based authentication flow with Supabase.
- **Optimized Health Indicators**: Refactored `RedisHealthIndicator` to use a lightweight `ping()` command instead of heavy job operations, reducing health check latency from seconds to milliseconds.

### 🎨 C. Frontend Polish & Live Data Integration

- **API Keys Page - Full CRUD**: Replaced static mock data with full API integration, implementing Create, Read, and Delete operations. Added a secure one-time display for new keys and copy-to-clipboard functionality.
- **Workflows Page - Live Data**: Migrated the Workflows page from mock data to live API calls using a standardized `authenticatedFetch` pattern. Implemented comprehensive loading, error, and empty states.

## 3. Key Technical Implementations

### API Key Security Redesign

The original validation logic was critically flawed. The new design follows security best practices.

**Before (Vulnerable):**

```typescript
// SECURITY VULNERABILITY - This could never work as bcrypt hashes are salted
const hashedKey = await this.hashApiKey(apiKey);
const { data } = await supabase.eq('hashed_key', hashedKey);
```

**After (Secure):**

```typescript
// Split key into a non-secret prefix and a secret, then use bcrypt.compare
const { prefix, secret } = this.splitApiKey(apiKey);
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('api_keys')
  .select('hashed_secret')
  .eq('prefix', prefix)
  .single();
if (!data) return null; // Key prefix not found

const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(secret, data.hashed_secret);
// ... proceed only if isValid is true
```

### Redis-based Idempotency Service

To support a distributed environment, the webhook idempotency mechanism was moved from an in-memory map to Redis, featuring distributed locking.

```typescript
// In WebhooksController
return this.idempotencyService.checkAndExecute(
  idempotencyKey,
  async () => {
    const job = await this.queueService.addJob(queueName, payload);
    return { status: 'accepted', jobId: job.id };
  },
  3600 // 1 hour TTL for idempotent responses
);
```

### Standardized Frontend Data Fetching

A consistent, reusable pattern for fetching data was established across all dashboard pages.

```typescript
// Standardized pattern for React components
const [data, setData] = useState<T[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    const response = await authenticatedFetch(`${apiUrl}/api/v1/resource`);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    const result = await response.json();
    setData(result.data || []);
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
}
```

### Shared Library Import Transformation

All applications were updated to use the new TypeScript path aliases for shared libraries.

**Before (Brittle, app-to-app import):**

```typescript
import { ConfigService } from '../../../apps/backend/src/config/config.service';
```

**After (Clean, library import):**

```typescript
import { ConfigService } from '@visapi/core-config';
```

## 4. New Shared Libraries & Configuration

### New Libraries

The core of the refactoring was the creation of seven shared libraries under `libs/`:

- **`@visapi/shared-types`**: Common TypeScript interfaces for the database, API, and queues.
- **`@visapi/shared-utils`**: Common utilities (e.g., date, string manipulation).
- **`@visapi/core-config`**: Shared configuration management for backend and worker.
- **`@visapi/core-supabase`**: Shared Supabase client and database access layer.
- **`@visapi/util-redis`**: Shared Redis client and the new `IdempotencyService`.
- **`@visapi/frontend-data-access`**: Frontend authentication helpers and API hooks.
- **`@visapi/frontend-ui-components`**: (Placeholder for future shared UI components).

### TypeScript Path Configuration

The `tsconfig.base.json` was updated with path aliases to support the new library structure:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@visapi/core-config": ["libs/backend/core-config/src/index.ts"],
    "@visapi/core-supabase": ["libs/backend/core-supabase/src/index.ts"],
    "@visapi/frontend-data": ["libs/frontend/data-access/src/index.ts"]
    // ... other paths
  }
}
```

## 5. Required Database Schema Changes

To support the new API key model, a database migration is required.

```sql
-- Update api_keys table for the new prefix/secret security model
ALTER TABLE public.api_keys
  ADD COLUMN prefix TEXT UNIQUE,
  ADD COLUMN hashed_secret TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- Drop the old, insecure column
ALTER TABLE public.api_keys DROP COLUMN hashed_key;

-- Add performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_api_keys_prefix ON public.api_keys(prefix);
CREATE INDEX idx_api_keys_user_id ON public.api_keys(user_id);
```

## 6. Build Status & Code Quality

- **Builds**: All applications (backend, worker, frontend) and shared libraries build successfully.
- **Tests**: **100% Pass Rate** - All 9 test suites, 70 tests passing consistently. Fixed critical issues in auth service mock chains and queue service method references.
- **Code Quality**:
  - **Zero App-to-App Imports**: Complete separation has been achieved and is enforced by NX.
  - **100% Shared Library Adoption**: All relevant code now uses shared libraries.
  - **Full Type Safety**: Shared types are used across applications, improving robustness.
  - **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error handling patterns implemented.
  - **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite covering all services, controllers, and guards.
- **Security Posture**: **Significantly Enhanced**. Mandatory idempotency keys, removal of hardcoded values, secure API key storage and validation, and proper JWT-based auth flows have resolved critical vulnerabilities.

## 7. Next Steps

With Sprint 2.5 complete, the codebase is now:

- ✅ **Architecturally Sound**: Proper separation of concerns with a scalable monorepo structure.
- ✅ **Secure**: Critical authentication and webhook vulnerabilities have been fixed.
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Shared libraries and consistent patterns make the code easier to manage.
- ✅ **Production-Ready**: The foundation is solid for deployment and future feature development.

The project is now well-positioned to begin **Sprint 3: Advanced Workflow Features**.
