## Facilitation Guidelines

### Effective Facilitation Techniques

#### Encouraging Participation

- Use round-robin questioning
- Avoid judgment or criticism
- Ask open-ended questions
- Encourage diverse perspectives
- Manage dominant personalities

#### Managing Group Dynamics

- Keep discussions on topic
- Manage time effectively
- Ensure all voices are heard
- Handle conflicts constructively
- Maintain energy levels

#### Documentation Best Practices

- Assign dedicated scribe
- Use visual aids effectively
- Document decisions and rationale
- Capture action items clearly
- Review and confirm understanding

### Common Facilitation Challenges

#### Challenge: Participants Focus on Implementation Details

**Solution:** Redirect to threat identification first, implementation later

#### Challenge: Overwhelming Number of Low-Risk Threats

**Solution:** Focus on high-impact threats, park low-risk items for later

#### Challenge: Disagreement on Risk Levels

**Solution:** Use structured scoring criteria and group consensus

#### Challenge: Limited Security Knowledge

**Solution:** Provide STRIDE examples and encourage questions

#### Challenge: Time Management Issues

**Solution:** Use timeboxing and parking lot for off-topic items
