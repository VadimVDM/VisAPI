# Sprint 0: Foundation Implementation Report

## Overview

Successfully established the core infrastructure for the VisAPI workflow automation platform. The monorepo structure is now set up with Next.js frontend, NestJS backend, and a complete development environment.

## Implementation Choices

### Architecture Decisions

**NX Monorepo Structure**: Chosen for its excellent TypeScript support, code sharing capabilities, and proven scalability for enterprise applications. The structure allows for:
- Shared code between frontend and backend
- Consistent tooling and build processes
- Scalable project organization

**Next.js 14 with App Router**: Selected for the frontend to leverage:
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Built-in optimizations for production
- Excellent developer experience
- Native TypeScript support

**NestJS for Backend**: Chosen for its:
- Decorator-based architecture similar to Angular
- Built-in dependency injection
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Modular structure ideal for microservices

### Development Environment

**Docker Compose**: Provides consistent development environment with:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching and queue management
- Adminer for database management
- Redis Commander for Redis monitoring

**Package Manager**: pnpm selected for:
- Faster installation times
- Efficient disk space usage
- Strict dependency management

## Changes Made

### Core Structure
- `apps/frontend/` - Next.js 14 application with App Router
- `apps/backend/` - NestJS API gateway application
- `packages/shared/` - Directory for shared utilities
- `packages/config/` - Directory for shared configuration
- `tools/scripts/` - Build and deployment scripts
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `infrastructure/` - Terraform and deployment configs

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Root package configuration with development scripts
- `nx.json` - NX workspace configuration
- `tsconfig.base.json` - Base TypeScript configuration
- `eslint.config.js` - Shared ESLint configuration
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier formatting configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Local development services

### Development Files
- `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore rules for all tools
- `README.md` - Complete setup and development documentation
- Development scripts for building, testing, and running services

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed

1. **Frontend Application**
   - ✅ Successfully starts on http://localhost:3001
   - ✅ Next.js 14 App Router is properly configured
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation works without errors
   - ✅ Hot reloading functions correctly

2. **Backend Application**
   - ✅ Successfully starts on http://localhost:3000/api
   - ✅ NestJS server initializes without errors
   - ✅ API endpoint `/api` responds correctly
   - ✅ Webpack build completes successfully

3. **Development Environment**
   - ✅ All NX commands execute without errors
   - ✅ Package installation works with pnpm
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
   - ✅ ESLint and Prettier configurations are valid

### Commands & Setup

**Initial Setup**
```bash
pnpm setup
```

**Development**
```bash
pnpm dev                 # Start all services
pnpm dev:frontend        # Start frontend only
pnpm dev:backend         # Start backend only
```

**Build & Test**
```bash
pnpm build              # Build all applications
pnpm test               # Run all tests
pnpm lint               # Lint all code
pnpm format             # Format all code
```

**Docker Services**
```bash
pnpm docker:up          # Start PostgreSQL & Redis
pnpm docker:down        # Stop all services
pnpm docker:logs        # View logs
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks for Sprint 1

1. **Database Setup**
   - Configure Supabase connection
   - Set up database migrations
   - Create core schema tables

2. **Authentication**
   - Implement Supabase auth in frontend
   - Set up auth guards and middleware
   - Create user management system

3. **API Foundation**
   - Add environment validation
   - Implement structured logging
   - Set up health check endpoints

4. **UI Components**
   - Set up Tailwind CSS
   - Install Shadcn/ui components
   - Create basic layout structure

### Future Enhancements

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Automated testing
   - Deployment to Vercel/Render

2. **Monitoring**
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - Log aggregation

## Notes

### Known Issues
- CI/CD pipeline not yet implemented (planned for future sprint)
- Database schema not yet created (next sprint priority)
- No authentication system in place (next sprint focus)

### Dependencies Ready
- **For you to set up**: Supabase project with connection details
- **Recommended**: Upstash Redis for production queue management
- **Optional**: Sentry for error tracking

### Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ Monorepo structure established
- ✅ Both applications start successfully
- ✅ Development environment fully functional
- ✅ Code quality tools configured
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Ready for Sprint 1 development

The foundation is solid and ready for building the core workflow automation features.
